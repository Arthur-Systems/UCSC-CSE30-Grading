## PROJECT PLAN: CSE30-GRADING-SYSTEM

### Project Scope:

#### Important Notes:

- There is an auto-grader capable of assessing student submissions using a predefined grading
  script. We do not need to remake this system.
- File output of grading results is managed by the existing auto-grading system we can use this to publish grades to
  students.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Automate Grading Process:**
    - Utilize Canvas API integration to automatically publish grades to students.
    - Ensure comprehensive inclusion of comments during the grading process.

2. **Detect Potential Cheating:**
    - Create a plagiarism detection Software.
    - Check submissions for instances of code sharing or copying.
    - Explore ways for checking code, such as function-by-function or
      block-by-block analysis.
    - Implement a system will flag potential cheating instances for manual review.

3. **Review Attendance Messages:**
    - Evaluate the coherence and relevance of attendance messages submitted by students.
    - Verify the accuracy of submission times for attendance records.

4. **Enhance Test Scripts:**
