## PROJECT PLAN: CSE30-GRADING-SYSTEM

### Project Scope:

#### Important Notes:

- There is an auto-grader capable of assessing student submissions using a predefined grading
  script. We do not need to remake this system.
- File output of grading results is managed by the existing auto-grading system we can use this to publish grades to
  students.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Automate Grading Process:**
    - Utilize Canvas API integration to automatically pull, grade, and if there is tine publish grades to students.
    - Ensure comprehensive inclusion of comments during the grading process.


2. **Review Attendance Messages:**
    - Evaluate the coherence and relevance of attendance messages submitted by students.
    - Verify the accuracy of submission times for attendance records.

3. **Enhance Test Scripts:**
    - Enhance the functionality and effectiveness of test scripts utilized by the auto-grading system.
